# Wedding-Planner
GOAL:
For this group project, we were tasked with creating a webpage from scratch using the front end and the back end. Here are the requirements for the coding:

   -Must use Node.js and Express.js to create a RSTFul API
   -Must us Handlebars.js as the template engine
   -Must use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
   -Must have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
   -Must use at least one new library, package, or technology that we havenâ€™t discussed
   -Must have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm
   -Must include authentication (express-session and cookies)
   -Must protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables

The project also includes the other requirements for additional features:
  
   -Must be deployed using Heroku (with data)
   -Must have a polished UI
   -Must be responsive
   -Must be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input)
   -Must meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, best practices, etc.)
   -Must have a professional README (unique name, description, link to the deployed app)

Here is an image of the final product:

PROCESS:

We started to brainstorm ideas that can fit all the requirements. We came up with all of the ideas throughout the brainstorm, but decided to go with the idea of a wedding planner. That fits all the requirements we need and also the majority of us agree to do the wedding planner. As we search a wedding planner to get some of the idea, what we can do with it. We all had a list of ideas, but in the end we went with the idea of where the user created an account, asked a question that needed to be fit out, and made a list of guests to the wedding. Also while create a account there is username and password. This meant the user can login back in and make changes.

In order to better understand and organize our idea, we created a User Story and Acceptance Criteria, dictating the purpose and use of our wedding planner:

USER STORY:

As person who is planning for wedding, I would like to get all the detail of my wedding one place. This can help understand what I have already and what I need as I continue planning for the wedding. This can help me with the details of the wedding and also many guests will come to the wedding and what kind of food I will order the most.


Acceptance Criteria:

Given a Wedding Planner

When you first enter the page, you are presented with login information and also there is an option if you don't have an account to sign up. As you can see in the image above.

When you click on the sign up button, you are presented with usernamd and password to create account. Once you are done with create account, you will be presented with more questions about the wedding. This questions will be saved up on the home page and you can view them every time you login to your account. Once you are login to your account you can add the guest to your list. While adding the guest on your list, there are two questions that are presented: what is the guest name and food choice. Once you submit the guest, it will be added below and each guest will have their own id.

When you click on the dashboard, you are presented with information you fill out the questions at begin after creating the account. In the dashboard you can re-edit the information like for example let's say you want to change your wedding date, you can do. Also you can add more information like some of the choices are DJ,photographer, and others.
 

 Conclusion:

 This assignment was unique to all of us in that it was the first time we worked together, as opposed to individually, to create a webpage use front end and back end. Because of this, we had the opportunity to use Git as it was intended: with different branches that were continuously merged and edited. We found that there is still a learning curve when comes to using Git's style of work-flow, but nothing that more practice can't make perfect

Brainstorming in a group format also gave us a better idea of what it would be like to be a coder in the work force. With more people, there are more ideas, which enhances the product as a whole. It is also valuable in that each person can learn from other group members, as everyone has their own style of coding and ways of debugging.

The biggest challenge we face is when it comes to individually working, some of us are fast learners and some of us are individually working. But we give each task to work on every time we meet up in class or outside of the class based on everyone's strength. That helped us to combine our work and work faster.

As with any product, there is always room for improvement. Given more time, we would have been able to expand on existing features as well as add new ones. Example of adding a code for the guest to login and add them to the list rather than the user adding them. This will make it easier for the wedding planner to see who is coming or not. That being said, the wedding planner is very user and already.
